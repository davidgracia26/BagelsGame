                <pre><strong>Welcome to Bagels!</strong>
The computer game Bagels was created by Resek and Rowe from the
Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, California. In the game of
Bagels, you must guess the number that the computer is thinking of.

You have 20 turns to guess the hidden number which is three digits and has unique digits.

Along the way, you will be given hints:

Pico - One digit correct but in the wrong position
Fermi - One digit correct and in the right position
Bagels - No digits correct

For example, the number is 398. Here are some sample responses:

435 - Pico (because 3 is a correct digit in the wrong position)
387 - Fermi Pico (because 3 is a correct digit in the right position
      but 8 is a correct digit in the wrong position)
419 - Bagels (because none of the digits are correct)
839 - Pico Pico Pico (because all of the digits are correct
      but in the wrong position)

In theory, you should be able to guess the number in 8 moves.
If you don't guess the number in 20 moves then you lose.
